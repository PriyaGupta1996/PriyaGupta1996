<p>
I love building things that scale, survive production, and actually reduce human effort.<br/>
Most of my work lives where engineering depth meets real world impact.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy thinking deeply about systems, breaking them down, rebuilding them better, and then watching them run smoothly in production.<br/>
Lately, that curiosity has pulled me into AI driven workflows, autonomous agents, and platform level engineering.
</p>

<p>
Outside my work, I like to slow down.<br/>
Yoga keeps me grounded 🧘‍♀️<br/>
Spending time with friends and family keeps me balanced 💛<br/>
Nature keeps me sane, so I’ve surrounded myself with 100+ plants at home :) 🌿
</p>

<p>
I constantly crave opportunities that push me to become a better engineer than yesterday.
</p>

<h3>🚧 What I’m working on right now</h3>

<p>
🤖 Designing LLM and VLM powered production systems<br/>
🧠 Building multi agent architectures that can reason, route, and act<br/>
⚙️ Modernizing legacy applications into cloud native platforms<br/>
📊 Creating observability first systems that are easy to operate and scale<br/>
🔐 Secure authentication and authorization flows
</p>



<h3>🧭 How I work</h3>

<p>
I like owning problems end to end.<br/>
From understanding the business context to designing the architecture, writing production ready code, reviewing PRs, and ensuring the system holds up under real traffic.
</p>

<p>
I care deeply about<br/>
📐 Clean abstractions<br/>
🔍 Observability<br/>
📉 Reducing operational load<br/>
📈 Long term maintainability
